# Damaged Aircraft MPC Controller
This project explores how Model Predictive Control (MPC) can be used to guide a dynamically impaired (damaged) aircraft to a safe landing.

The goal is to simulate a simple aircraft model, introduce time-varying dynamics degrade, and test how the use of a MPC controller can guide the aircraft to landing.

This project was developed as the final course project for UC Berkeley MECENG 231A – Model Predictive Control, in the Department of Mechanical Engineering.
