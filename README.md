# Damaged aircraft navigation path optimization MPC controller
A small project exploring Model Predictive Control (MPC) for a damaged / actuator-impaired aircraft.
The goal is to simulate a simple aircraft model, introduce a control-surface failure, and test how MPC reallocates control authority to guide the aircraft to landing.

Developed as part of the final project of UC Berkeley MECENG 231A Model Predictive Control course in the department of Mechanical Engineering.
